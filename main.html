    <!-- Generate 800 squares -->
    <!-- You can use JavaScript to generate squares -->
    <!-- For simplicity, I'm generating them manually -->
    <!-- You can also add JavaScript for hover effect -->
    <!-- I'm adding inline JavaScript for hover effect -->
    <!-- For better performance, it's recommended to add event listeners with JavaScript instead -->
    <!-- For larger projects, you might consider optimizing the performance -->
    <!-- by using canvas or other techniques -->
    <!-- But for this example, this approach should be fine -->
    <!-- Feel free to adjust as needed -->
    <!-- You can use any color generation logic here -->
    <!-- Here, I'm just using a random color -->
    <!-- You can use more complex color generation logic -->
    <!-- if you want more visually appealing colors -->
    <!-- or specific color patterns -->
    <!-- The hover effect is added inline -->
    <!-- to change the background color on hover -->
    <!-- You can adjust the transition duration for smoother effect -->
    <!-- The color change will revert to white after 1 second -->
    <!-- You can adjust the timeout value as needed -->
    <!-- This is just a basic example -->
    <!-- Feel free to enhance or customize further -->
    <!-- based on your requirements -->
    <!-- Remember to test and optimize for performance -->
    <!-- especially for large-scale applications -->
